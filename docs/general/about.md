# What is MPFB?

MPFB ("Makehuman Plugin For Blender") originally started out as a way to quickly load characters directly
from [MakeHuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org) without the need to first export or save the character
to a file.

However, after this initial goal was reached, MPFB has continued to evolve with functions and features of
its own.

For complete information about all features, refer to [the root of the documentation](../README.md). 
But the following are some of the more salient features:
