# When will it come for mac?

Blender plugins are not platform dependent. In theory a plugin should work on any platform that Blender runs on.

This said, the MPFB2 addon is not developed on, aimed at nor tested on mac. This is because no one of the current developers use mac, and thus have no way of testing it.

So it may work, or it might not. If you use mac and find an issue, you can [report it in the issues section](how_do_i_report_a_bug.md)
