# MPFB2

MPFB2 is a free and open source human generator for Blender. For documentation and FAQ, see  
[home page](http://static.makehumancommunity.org/mpfb.html)

In order to get up and running quickly, see the [quick start](http://static.makehumancommunity.org/mpfb/docs/getting_started.html) guide. 
The quick start guide is also where you can find download links.

Note that MPFB 2 requires a Blender version of at least 3.0.

## MPFB2 vs MPFB1

MPFB2 is a complete rewrite of MPFB1 with an entirely different code structure, which is why it is in a separate git repository. 
For a list of new features, see [the change log](http://static.makehumancommunity.org/mpfb/releases/release_20a1.html).

MPFB 2 should peacefully co-exist with MPFB 1, so there should be no problem with checking it out to see if it 
works for you.
