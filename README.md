# Makehuman Plugin For Blender (MPFB)

This is what is intended to become version 2 of MPFB. While most basic functionality (for example the importer) is
implemented and working, it is still a work in progress. For more information see the 
[current status](docs/general/status.md) page.

MPFB 2 should peacefully co-exist with MPFB 1, so there should be no problem with checking it out to see if it 
works for you.

Note that MPFB 2 requires a Blender version of at least 2.90.

## Documentation

The root of the documentation is [available here](docs/README.md). If you are unfamiliar with MPFB, you will want
to read [the introduction to what MPFB is](docs/general/about.md). Otherwise, the
[installation instructions](docs/general/install.md) might be a good place to start.
