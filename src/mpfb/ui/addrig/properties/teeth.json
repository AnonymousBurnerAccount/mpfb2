Instead, the standard rigify way of handling this is having separate objects for upper and lower teeth and having the lower teeth object as a child of the lower teeth bone. This is incompatible with the MakeHuman teeth assets. Here you can choose which strategy to adopt when generating a rigify rig that influences teeth.",
